# Computer-Organization

Here are some assignments about Computer Organization, including verilog and MIPS instruction set.  
Each folder has a description and a report related to the assignment.

## HW1 Introduction : 

Use verilog to simulate traffic light.  
(4 states : Red, Green, Yellow and None) and design with finite state machine.  

## HW2 Introduction : 

Use MIPS instruction set to implement Fibonacci number.  

## HW3 Introduction (實作出一個RISC CPU): 

The goal of this homework is to understand how a RISC-V work and how to use Verilog hardware description language (Verilog HDL) to model electronic systems.   
That is, implement ALU and decoder module and make our codes be able to execute all RISC-V instructions.  

## HW4 Introduction : 

Write a cache simulator, and compare the implementation of the cache and their miss rate between different conditions.  
Conditions are determined by input.   
  
Conditions : 
Associativity : Direct-mapped, four-way set associative, fully associative.
Replace algorithm : FIFO, LRU,  MRU(Most Recently Used).
